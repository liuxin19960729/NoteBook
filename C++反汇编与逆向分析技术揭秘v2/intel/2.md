# Chapter 2 System Architecture overview
```
IA-32 architecture(begining with the Intel 386 family) provides extensive support for operating system and system development software.
   support mutiple modes of operation 
        1. Real mode,
        2.protected mode
        3.virtual 8086 mode
        4.system management mode

### 2.1.1 Global and Local Descriptor Tables
```
When operating in protected mode, all memory accesses pass through through either the global descriptor table (GDT) or an optional local descriptor table (LDT) as shown in Figure 2-1. T

To access a byte in a segment, a segment selector and an offset must be supplied.


This mechanism can be used to access any valid code ,data or stack segment,provided the segment is accessible from the current  privilege level(CPL) at which the processor is operating .The CPL id defined as the protection level of the curently executing code segment.
